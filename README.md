## Project Overview
Welcome to the Netflix Data Analysis project! In this repository, I explore the Netflix dataset using Python for data analysis. My goal is to uncover interesting insights and trends within the vast collection of movies and TV shows available on Netflix.
## Data sources 
This Netflix dataset has information about the tv shows and Movies available on Netflix till 2021  
The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine,and available on Kaggle website for free
## Tools Used
- Python 
- Pandas   
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase,I performed the following tasks : 
1. Data loading and inspectation
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

## Exporatory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for understanding the Netflix dataset, uncovering patterns, trends, and insights. In this section, I explore various aspects of the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of the content available on Netflix, addressing key questions:

1. **Release Trends Over the Years:**
   - In which year did the highest number of TV shows and movies release? (Visualized using a Bar Graph)

2. **Movies and TV Shows by Top 10 Directors:**
   - Show all records where the category is "Movie" and type is "Comedians" or the country is "United Kingdom." Additionally, display the top 10 directors who gave the highest number of TV shows and movies to Netflix. (Visualized using a Bar Graph)

3. **Different Ratings Defined by Netflix:**
   - What are the different ratings defined by Netflix?
     
## Results 

The Netflix dataset analysis reveals significant trends. The year 2019 stands out with the most releases, marking a pivotal moment in Netflix content production. Ra√∫l Campos, Jan Suter, and Marcus Raboy lead in directorial contributions, emphasizing their impact on Netflix's diverse content landscape. The dataset's ratings, encompassing 'TV-MA,' 'R,' 'PG-13,' etc., showcase the platform's commitment to varied content suitability. The United States dominates TV show contributions, emphasizing its global influence. A concise bar graph illustrates the distribution of movies and TV shows, highlighting insights into content diversity.

## Recommendation
For those intrigued by the dynamics of Netflix content, this project offers a compelling exploration of key facets. The detailed analyses and visualizations provide a nuanced understanding of release patterns and directorial contributions. The inclusion of content ratings and a focus on top directors enhance the depth of insights. The project's use of a bar graph to represent distribution adds clarity. Overall, this analysis serves as a valuable reference for individuals interested in content consumption trends on streaming platforms, providing a comprehensive overview of Netflix's evolving content landscape.
